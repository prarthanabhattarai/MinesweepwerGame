I made this Minesweeper Game as a class project for the class ‘Introduction to Object Oriented Programming’

To play the game, choose either of the three difficulty levels- beginner, intermediate and advanced. Click on the box you think is mine-free. The number shown reflects the number of mine hidden in the adjacent boxes around the clicked box. A game is won is a player correctly identifies all the mine-free boxes.

How to run the program:

Download the folder to desktop.
Open Eclipse and import the folder to workspace.
Run the file MinesweeperApplication.java located in src folder.

The folder also contains a runnable jar file, MinesweeperGame.jar, which can be used to play the game, without compiling the source files.
